# MutualComprehension
A magnificent C++ program which let you increase or decrease the comprehension between you and your friends !

Up and runnin'! You only have to specify these four variable in the cpp file : 

- const char* SERVEUR = "your-server-name";
- const char* LOGIN = "your-login";
- const char* PASSWORD = "your-password";
- const char* DTB = "your-database-name";

If you wan't to store your data online I advise you to use thise website → sql7.freemysqlhosting.net and access your data from here → http://www.phpmyadmin.co.
